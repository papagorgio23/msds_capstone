Current VA policy on this issue, including the Advance Practice Nurses final rule 38 CFR  17.415 and Directive 1123, which provide for physician led anesthesia care within VA, should be preserved.   There are no independent studies that support that the solo nurse model of anesthesia care is safe for Veteran. VAs own self funded examination of literature on this subject in the September 2014 Quality Enhancement Research Initiative QUERI concluded  In general, patients managed by solo CRNAs were less complex than those managed by solo MDs. Despite adjustment for patient characteristics age, sex, and race, procedure complexity captured with procedure base units, and year, the methods used in the study to capture the complexity of surgery and relevant comorbidity were not adequate to exclude selection bias as an explanation for the results. That is, the lack of differences in patient outcomes might be due to triage of less complex cases to CRNAs.  The results of these studies do not provide any guidance on how to assign patients for management by a solo CRNA, or whether more complex surgeries can be safely managed by CRNAs, particularly in small or isolated VA hospitals where preoperative and postoperative health system factors may be less than optimal.

The Veterans Health Administration has already established national standards of practice for physician anesthesiologists and nurse anesthetists, formalizing policies that ensure the safest, team based model of care for anesthesia.    Surgery and anesthesia are inherently dangerous, and Veterans must have access to the same physician led, team based anesthesia care that civilians receive. I urge VA to uphold its current patient centered policies governing safe anesthesia care including the Advance Practice Nurses final rule 38 CFR  17.415 and Directive 1123, which provide for physician led anesthesia care for Veterans.   The physician led, high quality anesthesia care team was reaffirmed after an exhaustive, multi year review that garnered a record breaking number of comments   more than 200,000 comments during two public rule makings   overwhelmingly in favor of ensuring our nations Veterans do not receive a lower standard of anesthesia care than the general public. Veterans and their families have spoken.  VA should not take any action to lower the standard of care for VA patients, and the issue should not be reopened through any new policy or subregulatory action following this interim final rule.      It is imperative that VAs National Anesthesia Services NAS, VAs well established experts in  anesthesia care set  any anesthesia policy that would impact our nations Veterans.   I strongly urge VA to uphold the safe, high quality physician led team based model of anesthesia care that exists within VA and at our nations top hospitals.
